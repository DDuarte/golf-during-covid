# Golf-During-Covid™

Code Golfing during COVID for the nerds amongst us.

## But what is code golfing?

> "Code golf is a type of recreational computer programming competition in which participants strive to achieve the shortest possible source code that implements a certain algorithm." — Wikipedia

## What languages can I use?

Any language is accepted, as long as it is considered non-recreational. 

## What is a recreational language?

> "Several new languages have been created specifically with code golfing in mind. Examples include GolfScript and Flogscript, which are Turing-complete languages which provide constructs for concisely expressing ideas in code. Because golfing languages compete for extreme brevity, their design sacrifices readability which is important for practical production environments, and therefore they are often esoteric." — Wikipedia

## But I see people using a language that sounds like F"#$ O"$

Yes. It is called [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)). And although it _seems_ like a recreational language, it was (as is) in fact used in many production systems. It just turned out to be quite compact for code golfing problems where array manipulation is of the essence. We'll see if it can keep up (character-wise) with problems of a different nature.

## Who's participating?

Well, mainly people somehow related to the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto (professors, students, alumni...); but mostly, we are all just friends hanging out virtually ;^)

## Can I participate?

Why not?... Just submit a Pull Request.

## Can I challenge you guys?

Why not?... Just submit a Pull Request. We have a one problem per week rule now, after the untoward weekend of April 18th.
