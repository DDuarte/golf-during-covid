# Challenge 6 (26/04/2020): Niven Numbers

## Specification

A niven number is a non-negative number that is divisible by the sum of its digits. Print all the niven numbers from 0 to 100 inclusive, each on their own line. (Source: https://code-golf.io/niven-numbers)

You need to create a function/method named `niven` with two optional arguments in its signature defining the range of the domain. Those arguments may have the defaults of 0 and 100, respectively, e.g., `niven(s=0,t=100)`. The function needs to compute the solution. It is not acceptable to use any pre-computed data structure or solution.
